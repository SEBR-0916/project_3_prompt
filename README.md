# Project 3 - Group Full-Stack MERN

![MERN](https://geeksperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mern-img.png")

## Task

Your task is to build a full-stack (Mongoose/Express/React/Node), professional-looking application with a functioning backend and frontend. Your website should allow users to interact with its pages, make _requests_ (buttons, HTML forms, dropdowns, searchbars, etc.) to your backend, and *display the data* (text, images, etc.) in a meaningful way. Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed README (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart or other) for the frontend
- A **public** Trello board for tracking your development progress with goals and tasks for the coming weekend
- Proposals will be Friday Morning. You may create a slideshow presentation if you would like to add to your proposal
- Proposals must include responsibilities/tasks for each group member as well as goals and schedule for the long weekend and project week

## **Project _Approval_ Due Date:** 6/21/24 by 9:00am EST

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**

- Be in **new repos**. Create a new repo in your github  for Front End and Back End, and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 3, give it a real name.
- Be written using the languages and frameworks *learned in this course so far*
- Have a separate directory for the frontend (client) and have your backend within the main repository.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Your README should have your name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your ERD, Component Diagrams, Wireframes and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of 3 Associated Mongoose Models
- Have Full CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations across Front and Back Ends
- Display data from each model on the frontend 
- Must be able to navigate between different pages (React Router)
- Have at least **50 _meaningful_ `git` commits**. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.


## **Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 6/28/23 by 9:00am EST

## Tips

-  Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration.
- Decide who will be git lead in your group and start brainstorming as soon as possible.Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements _before_ moving on to post-MVP features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)


## Post-MVP Ideas

**Before attempting _any_ of these post-MVP ideas, you must demonstrate your working MVP to your instructor, then attempt these on a _new branch_ 

- Hidden routes using conditional rendering to mimic the functionality of user authentication
- Implement OAuth
- Integrate a 3rd party API (Ask us for a list)


## Help 
- Each group will have 5 Tokens to redeem for 1 on 1 help sessions through the project week
- Each Token will grant 20 minutes of 1 on 1 help with your instructors

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is ***not acceptable to copy*** another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to ***ask your instructor***. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
